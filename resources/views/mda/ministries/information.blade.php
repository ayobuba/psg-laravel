            <li>As the voice of government and its image maker, the Ministry left no stone unturned in ensuring that government activities and those that concern the general public are adequately publicized through the various media of communication in the State within the limited available resources.</li>
            <li>The Department coordinated the media briefings by the Hon. Commissioner on the weekly meetings of the State Executive Council at the Government House. </li>
            <li>The staff of the Ministry supported the Hon. Commissioner in organizing several Press Conferences on very vital issues either at the NUJ Press Centre or in the Ministry, as the situation entailed. A few of such cases in point were the unfortunate May 20th twin bomb blasts in Jos, the campaign against Ebola outbreak, campaigns on digitization, civic registration and distribution of the INEC Voters Cards, the 70th Birthday of Governor Jonah Jang and the burial arrangement for the late elder statesman, Sen. John Wash Pam among many others. </li>

It also provided for a platform for the Hon. Commissioner and management to interface with the Information Officers at the grassroots level. </li>
            <li>There has been a marked improvement in the working relationship between the Ministry and the various media organizations and their personnel. This could be attributed to the meetings and the reach-out steps by the Commissioner and management to various professional bodies such as the State Chapter of the NUJ; the Correspondents Chapel of the NUJ; NAWOJ; League of Veteran Journalists; NIPR, RATTAWU and other similar professional organizations, seeking their understanding and collaboration with the Ministry in enhancing effective information service delivery to and for Plateau people. </li>

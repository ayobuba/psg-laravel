            <li>Metallic Mineral Dressing and Processing plant</li>
            <li>The Derivation stone project</li>
            <li>The Gem City Project (Jewelry and Gems)</li>
            <li>The Burnt (Clay) Bricks projects</li>
        </ol>

        <h4>REPORTS</h4>
        <p>
            The Ministry has received the interim report on the categorization of mine ponds for various applications. It has also requested for a special intervention fund from the Revenue Mobilization Allocation and fiscal Commission to ameliorate the impact of pass mining activities.
            <ol type="i">
                <li>A feasibility study for establishment of Granite Cutting and Polishing plant in Plateau State. It was only of recent that entrepreneurs began to show interest in the development of this natural resource. However Nigeria is still a net importer of finished stone tiles for floor and wall cladding. A Geological survey already completed, has been carried out by the Plateau State Government, which led to the discovery of a wide range of coloured granite in the state. They are of the variety that commands high demand both locally and internationally. </li>
                <li>A feasibility report on Kaolin, Gypsum, and Hydrated lime industrial Complex. The intention of the state administration is to stimulate the private sector of the economy to invest in primary production.</li>
                <li>Market study for Clay-Brick products in Jos. The brick and Clay products can be classified into building bricks, decorative products and special products. But this is proposed to increase the supply of building materials in Jos thereby creating employment opportunities.</li>

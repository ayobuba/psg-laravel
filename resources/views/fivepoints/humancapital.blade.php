            The major goal here is to accelerate sustainable socio-economic development through the use of the state’s vast human and natural resources to address poverty, to unleash the potentials of citizens for self-actualization, and guarantee the promotion and protection of their individual welfare. One of our developmental strategies is to diversify the economy and strengthen sectoral linkages towards reaping from the resultant multiplier effect through the 3-E Dimensional Strategies of Employment, Empowerment and Engagement.

            The Rt.Hon. Lalong administration feels that in view of the prevailing economic circumstances in the state, there is no alternative to agricultural revolution. This is even more so for the fact that the state is blessed with a resourceful people, fertile arable land and favorable climate conditions which have endowed it with comparative advantage in agriculture. In this vain, the mission is take agriculture beyond the frontiers of subsistence by encouraging large-scale mechanized agriculture, while the vision is for the state to be a major player in food production for both domestic and international consumption. The administration has since keyed into the ALL GREEN ALTERNATIVE of the Federal Government which is a pragmatic and time-bound policy (2014-2020) aimed at boosting local production, promoting food security and cutting food imports.

            The economy of Plateau state is still largely dominated by the primary production sector, with agriculture, which is predominantly subsistence, peasant and characterized by low and declining productivity. The administration recognizes the key roles of the real and manufacturing sectors of the economy in complementarily and mutually providing both forward and backward integrations especially for food processing and other agro-related industries. The components of the 3rd policy of the Rescue Mission are tailored towards guaranteeing food security in the state via sustainable local food production as well as improving the lot of the rural populace through infrastructural developments and service delivery. The administration also considers that efforts to raise rural welfare must necessary go beyond the traditional and limited approach of raising per capita income through agricultural development projects, to the provision of rural basic needs and social amenities: health and medical facilities, rural transportation facilities (roads and bridges), electricity or energy, pipe-borne water and rural infrastructure such as school, market stalls, etc.

                <strong>Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs):</strong>  The complementary roles of the SDGs in the development of the state since the inception of this administration cannot be ignored. Between 2015 and 2016, the SDGs office has constructed 86 classrooms, 20 PHCs, 17 Boreholes and 9 VIP toilets in rural areas of the state. In September 2016, it donated 13 state-of the-art ambulances to 6 LGAs in the State-Jos North, B/Ladi, Mangu, Kanke, Shendam and Wase.

                <strong>Farm Inputs Distribution: </strong> Prompt and transparent distribution of fertilizers, herbicides, pesticides and other farm inputs to Farmers in the state was undertaken in the previous farming seasons. In particular, the agricultural policy of the administration is aimed at removing the inefficient fertilizer subsidy regime in fertilizer supply in order to benefit small-holder and large-scale farmers.

                <strong>Ranching Policy: </strong> In line with the yearnings and aspirations of the people, the administration has adopted the ranching policy as opposed to grazing reserves and permanent grazing routes, which were approved and Gazetted by the immediate past administration. This is aimed at increasing livestock production, scaling up economic empowerment and protection of the environment through modern concept of ranching. The policy also has a security component, which is aimed at curbing incessant herdsmen/farmers clashes, which in the previous years have been the bane of our progress and development as a state.

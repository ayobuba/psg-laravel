            The importance of infrastructure in turning an economy around cannot be over emphasized. It is true as revealed by the Federal Ministry of Budget and National Planning that Nigeria requires $3 trillion to fund infrastructure projects in the next 30 years under the National Integrated Infrastructure Master Plan. The implementation of this plan would indeed be done by way of collaboration between the federal and State Governments and the private sector. Under the plan, the public sector will handle 52% of the projects with the remaining percentage to be handled by the private sector. For us on the Plateau, though we cannot easily quantify the monetary implications for infrastructure projects, the challenges posed by infrastructural decay and deficits are quite enormous.

            Indeed, physical infrastructure in the state was found to be in a deplorable sate. This called for concerted efforts in this direction. In view of this, the state roadmap for infrastructural development has been geared towards improving some critical sectors of the economy- Agriculture, Tourism, Solid Minerals, Transport, Power and Energy, ICT, Housing, Security, Rural Development, Education and Health Services and other forms of Social Infrastructure. The goal is to ensure affordable access to all these and as well create a clean sustainable environment for healthy and decent living for the citizens. Despite limited resources, the robust frame work for infrastructural development is already yielding results. In spite of resources constraint, the Gov. Simon Lalong administration has in about 3 years undertaken the following infrastructural projects.

            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>Rural Infrastructure and Urban Renewal:</strong> On inception, the Rt. Hon. Lalong administration discovered that rural and urban infrastructure have been in state of decay. Government decided to accord top priority to this very important sector in view of the desire to put the state on a sound developmental pedestal. Rural and urban roads as well as other very critical infrastructure have indeed received the intervention of the administration.

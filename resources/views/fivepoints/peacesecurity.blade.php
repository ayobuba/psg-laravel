            These three elements go together and they as sound management platforms are preconditions for effective development. Peace, Security and Good Governance are core elements of any pragmatic and people oriented administration. These have become of the fulcrums of the Rt. Hon. Simon Bako Administration which is poised to better the lot of the citizens of the state. The administration recognizes the importance of these three elements, just as the NEPAD Peer Review Mechanism of 2003 has declared that: “poverty can only be effectively tackled through the promotion of democracy, good governance, peace and security.”
